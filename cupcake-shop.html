    <h2>About Us</h2>
    <p>The <span class="flashy">three</span> of us came from different backgrounds but we all had an interest to learn coding. We met at Epicodus and one of the practices in the lesson wanted us to create a cupcake shop. <span class="best">Alex</span> came up with the birthday cake idea, <span class="best">Frank</span> came up with the red velvet idea, and <span class="best">Jonathan</span> came up with the matcha idea. After graduating from Epicodus, we decided to implement our ideas from this lesson and open a cupcake shop while we look for jobs in the tech industry. Hopefully, our cupcakes can sweeten up your lives just as they do to ours.</p>
